-- refactor the load file interaction with the read stack process
--Add logs and formatting in pretty boxes.
--remove old specs/usage in proof_server.ml
-- Better loading/saving of session
-- Adding more units test to prop
--Finish the first_order layer once prop is finished
--Clean the session to be able to marshal them

--Notations and substitutions : when substituting within a notation, 
should we just 
-substitute the parameters of the notation
or
-apply the notation and then subsitute, to see if there is a collision during subsitution with  a free variable occuring only in the notation semantics (and not its syntax) ?


-- Add a Readme
-- Clean the server side : closes channels nicely
